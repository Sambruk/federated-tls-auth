# Sample client code for federated TLS authentication

This project was funded through NLnet and the NGI0 PET Fund, a fund established
with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet
programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and
Technology under grant agreement No 825310.

The project is a collaboration between Internetstiftelsen and FÃ¶reningen
Sambruk.

The code was developed originally for the EGIL SCIM client, in order to securely
connect to and authenticate a SCIM server, with the help of authentication
metadata from Skolfederation. The code in this repository however has no
dependencies on the EGIL SCIM client and can be re-used in other projects which
need to do the same kind of secure communication.

## Contents

### Tools
In the `tools` directory are scripts that make it easier to fetch, verify
and inspect authentication metadata. For more information, see the
[README](tools/README.md) file in that directory.

### Metadata parsing and authentication example
The `src` directory contains C++ code for interpreting the metadata and
an example program which shows how to use this code, and how it can be used
to connect to and authenticate a server. For more information, see the
[README](src/README.md) file in that directory.
